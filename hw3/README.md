# CSE 490/599 G1 Homework 3 #

Welcome friends,

The third assignment is entirely Colab based. Upload the `homework3_colab.ipynb` file and get to work. 


## 1. PyTorch ##
Navigate to: https://colab.research.google.com/

and upload the iPython notebook provided: `homework3_colab.ipynb`

Complete the notebook to train a PyTorch RNN on character generation.

## Turn it in ##

First `cd` to the `hw3` directory. Download your copy of `homework3_colab.ipynb` from Colab and replace the original file.
Then run the `submit.sh` script by running:

```bash
bash submit.sh
```

This will create the file `submit.tar.gz` in your directory with all the code you need to submit. The command will check to see that your files have changed relative to the version stored in the `git` repository. If it hasn't changed, figure out why, maybe you need to download your ipynb from google?

Submit `submit.tar.gz` in the file upload field for Homework 1 on Canvas.
